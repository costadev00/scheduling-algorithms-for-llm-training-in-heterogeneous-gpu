# Scenario 2 (160 Tasks) Report

This scenario scales the workload to 160 tasks with processor counts RC = 2, 4, 8 to evaluate scalability of HEFT and PEFT under the enhanced metrics (makespan, load balance ratio, communication cost, waiting time, energy).

## Raw Metrics Summary
The following table is produced by `summarize_scenario2_160.py` (values rounded):

| Algorithm | RC | Makespan | Load Balance Ratio | Comm Cost | Waiting Time | Energy Cost |
|-----------|----|----------|--------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| HEFT | 2 | 40.27 | 1.07 | 175.05 | 21.46 | 1970.49 |
| PEFT | 2 | 49.24 | 1.20 | 177.00 | 21.55 | 1704.31 |
| HEFT | 4 | 36.58 | 1.23 | 446.63 | 18.46 | 3293.17 |
| PEFT | 4 | 57.11 | 1.70 | 504.47 | 22.95 | 1974.98 |
| HEFT | 8 | 20.35 | 2.74 | 268.16 | 9.00 | 1486.17 |
| PEFT | 8 | 34.95 | 3.81 | 439.38 | 14.88 | 753.36 |

(Note: Higher load balance ratio indicates poorer balance; ideal is closer to 1.)

## Observations
- Makespan: HEFT achieves consistently lower makespan across all RC values; the gap widens at higher RC, suggesting HEFT exploits additional processors more aggressively here.
- Energy: PEFT consumes less energy at every RC, with especially pronounced savings at RC=8 (roughly half of HEFT).
- Communication Cost: HEFT shows lower communication cost at RC=2 & 4; PEFT carries higher comm overhead, possibly due to placement choices optimizing for energy.
- Waiting Time: HEFT yields lower average waiting times, aligned with shorter makespans.
- Load Balance: Both algorithms show degraded balance at higher RC (ratios >2), indicating idle time inflation when parallelism exceeds DAG concurrency; PEFT suffers more imbalance.

## Trade-offs
- HEFT favors performance (makespan) at the expense of higher energy at larger RC (except RC=8 where HEFT's energy also drops substantially but still above PEFT).
- PEFT prioritizes energy efficiency, trading off longer schedules and higher communication overhead.

These visualize the divergent scaling patterns for the two algorithms.

## Next Steps / Ideas
- Investigate hybrid objective (e.g., weighted sum of finish time and energy) to close energy gap while preserving HEFT's makespan advantage.
- Explore task clustering to reduce communication amplification observed for PEFT at higher RC.
- Evaluate sensitivity to bandwidth heterogeneity and power variance distributions.
