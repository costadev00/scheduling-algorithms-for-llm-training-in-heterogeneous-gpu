# Scenario 3 (300 Tasks) Report

This scenario evaluates HEFT and PEFT on a large randomly generated DAG set (300 tasks) for processor counts RC = 2, 4, 8. All structural and performance parameters (graph height, out-degree, CCR, heterogeneity, data sizes, bandwidths) were randomly sampled per RC variant.

## Raw Metrics Summary
(From `scenario3_summary.csv`, rounded for readability.)

| Algorithm | RC | Makespan | Load Balance Ratio | Comm Cost | Waiting Time | Energy Cost |
|-----------|----|----------|--------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| HEFT | 2 | 413.90 | 1.01 | 886.00 | 218.15 | 879693.04 |
| PEFT | 2 | 425.54 | 1.02 | 782.16 | 211.39 | 923579.96 |
| HEFT | 4 | 66.35 | 1.07 | 535.63 | 36.39 | 266711.15 |
| PEFT | 4 | 68.21 | 1.08 | 517.09 | 35.89 | 276806.71 |
| HEFT | 8 | 78.66 | 1.64 | 1335.97 | 34.14 | 418629.05 |
| PEFT | 8 | 94.14 | 1.66 | 1318.31 | 38.06 | 497236.57 |

## Observations (Vanilla Makespan-Focused Versions)
- Makespan: Gaps narrowed markedly vs earlier energy-aware variants. PEFT is within ~3% at RC=4 and ~2.8% at RC=2; larger gap remains at RC=8.
- Energy: Without energy-sensitive selection, PEFT energy rose above HEFT at all RC. HEFT no longer pays an energy penalty.
- Communication: PEFT now slightly lower at RC=4 and RC=8, lower at RC=2 as well—reverse of earlier pattern at higher RC counts.
- Waiting Time: Tracks makespan; PEFT’s modest delays reflect its still larger EFT+OCT sums at RC=8.
- Load Balance: Both retain good balance at RC=2/4; moderate divergence at RC=8 (ratios ~1.64–1.66) but far improved from earlier PEFT imbalance.

## Trade-offs After Reversion
- Strategy alignment: Both algorithms now optimize makespan per their canonical definitions; energy is purely reported.
- Energy vs Makespan: With energy heuristics removed, energy becomes a byproduct; HEFT happens to be lower for RC=2–4 here, PEFT higher across the board.
- Scaling: RC=8 still yields diminishing returns; investigate whether critical path length or communication bottlenecks dominate.

## Potential Follow-Ups
- Multi-seed experiments to quantify variance of narrowed gaps.
- Optional flag to re-enable energy-aware modes for comparative studies.
- Critical path analysis to understand limited benefit of RC=8 vs RC=4.
