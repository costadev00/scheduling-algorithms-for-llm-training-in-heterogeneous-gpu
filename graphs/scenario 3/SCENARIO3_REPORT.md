# Scenario 3 (300 Tasks) Report

This scenario evaluates HEFT and PEFT on a large randomly generated DAG set (300 tasks) for processor counts RC = 2, 4, 8. All structural and performance parameters (graph height, out-degree, CCR, heterogeneity, data sizes, bandwidths) were randomly sampled per RC variant.

## Raw Metrics Summary
(From `scenario3_summary.csv`, rounded for readability.)

| Algorithm | RC | Makespan | Load Balance Ratio | Comm Cost | Waiting Time | Energy Cost |
|-----------|----|----------|--------------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| HEFT | 2 | 417.27 | 1.01 | 794.02 | 221.02 | 857098.69 |
| PEFT | 2 | 444.42 | 1.08 | 857.59 | 213.24 | 674048.07 |
| HEFT | 4 | 65.68 | 1.07 | 520.88 | 35.32 | 213362.12 |
| PEFT | 4 | 90.48 | 1.39 | 509.64 | 44.48 | 162175.20 |
| HEFT | 8 | 76.50 | 1.68 | 1324.27 | 33.30 | 341917.85 |
| PEFT | 8 | 144.97 | 3.03 | 2049.74 | 51.59 | 178943.81 |

## Observations
- Makespan: HEFT dominates on makespan at all RC; the improvement is most dramatic at RC=4 and RC=8.
- Energy: PEFT uses substantially less energy (≈21%–34% savings) relative to HEFT for each RC.
- Communication Cost: Mixed—PEFT has slightly lower cost at RC=4, but higher at RC=2 and notably higher at RC=8.
- Waiting Time: Correlates with makespan; HEFT's shorter schedules reduce average task start times.
- Load Balance: Both near 1 for RC=2 and RC=4 (good). At RC=8, imbalance grows; PEFT shows considerably worse balance (ratio >3) indicating idle skew.

## Trade-offs
- HEFT more aggressively exploits available parallelism, slashing makespan but incurring higher energy usage.
- PEFT focuses on energy-efficient placements, trading off longer schedules and, in this run, higher communication at larger RC.
- Diminishing returns: Jump from RC=4 to RC=8 does not reduce HEFT makespan (actually increases slightly), suggesting parallelism saturation or communication bottlenecks.

## Potential Follow-Ups
- Investigate cause of HEFT makespan regression from RC=4 to RC=8 (overheads, critical path elongation, or load imbalance).
- Apply energy-time composite objective to narrow gap while preserving performance.
- Run multiple random seeds for statistical confidence intervals.
